#+title:Changes that still should happen



* Speed up flux-extraction

* Save coordinates, flux, order/fiber 

* in tools.py:
- gain/exposureTime/darkRate should be read from fitsFile (if this is in the file)

* Include gain/exposureTime/darkRate in .fits header

* Should use S/N to find the correct #pixels around the polynomial fit to inlcude
Maxize S/N wrp amound of pixels around:
- [ ] where orders is verticall
- [ ] where the value is maximal
- [X] when we are in the middle row

=> Check which one of these gives better results


* (Flat field) Responce of instrument (in horizontal direction)
- Check background between orders and see how they vary, depending on position. This gives a idea of the _responce_ of the detector. (See p.38 of the thesis of Nicholas)
- TODO: At some point, check how much this influences our respults


* Make a README file that explains installing/starting the pipeline


* Include input hash in output fits file
